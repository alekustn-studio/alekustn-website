  title: "When we were Kids",
  description: "A work that goes back to our childhood.\n\nWhen I was a kid I loved spending time with my grandmother and parents, we took a lot of walks with them, looked at different houses, spent time in nature, painted and in general were very much involved in the creative component, it was my parents and grandmother who instilled in me a love for creativity.\n\nProbably one of the few things that have survived to these days is my childhood drawings, a little funny, sloppy, but so real and sincere.\n\nIn this work I wanted to take me back to those carefree times and remember with what eagerness and zeal I tried every day to learn something new or to go further than before.\n\nNone of this would have happened without my family, for which I am truly grateful.\n\n10% of primary sales will be donated to Cure Parkinson's, I hope all children will have a childhood where they can spend time with their loved ones.\n\nBe patient, some variations take a little longer to render.\n\nMade with p5js.",
