  title: "Tomorrow",
  description: "Tomorrow is probably the biggest uncertainty of our lives.\n\nWe hang absolutely everything on tomorrow, the beginning of a new life, training, studies, hopes, expectations, dreams, and many other things, the list can be very long.\n\nBut how often do our expectations come true?\n\nThis year I hope everyone understood that you cannot hope and count on tomorrow, there is no tomorrow, there is only today.\nStop putting everything off until tomorrow, you may just not notice how your life flew by and you ended up not doing so much.\n\nThe shape of the circle was not chosen by chance, it represents the cyclical nature of our lives and everything we do.\nBut even in this there are exceptions, expecting that tomorrow everything will go on the same scenario, everything goes exactly the opposite.\n\n15 palettes.\n5 formats.\n2 different drawing modes.\n\nMade with p5js.",
