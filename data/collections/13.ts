  description: "The \"Ripples\" collection epitomises the elegance of generative design, characterised by its recursive layering of complexity and storytelling potential. Aleks describes the genesis of his work: \"Most of my works emerge from daily experimentsâ€¦ probably only 1 out of 1,000 of these experiments can eventually turn into a full-fledged collection.\" This iterative process embodies an openness where discovery is paramount, and unexpected results spark the development of cohesive series. Each generative cycle ensures that no two pieces are identical, inviting viewers to engage with the collection repeatedly to uncover evolving details and hidden nuances.\n\nThe collection's resistance to a definitive endpoint positions each artwork as a dynamic element within an interconnected web of interpretation. This approach encourages continuous viewer interaction and deepens the narrative that each piece contributes to the whole.\n\nMade with p5js.",
