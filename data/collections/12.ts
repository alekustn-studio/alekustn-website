  description: "Tessellation series.\n\nTessellation is a series of computer-generated artworks randomly generated in a chain.\n\nThe series was inspired by the works of Paul Klee, especially \"New Harmony\" and \"Main Road and its Branches\".\n\nScales, shapes, colors... The Tessellation series is an artistic exploration and interpretation of these concepts.\n\nTessellation represents the code's ability to generate a variety of geometric shapes that form mosaics, presenting you with abstract paintings.\n\n\"Tessellation is more than what you see.\"\n\nMade with p5js.",
