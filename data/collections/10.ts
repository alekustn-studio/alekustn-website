  description: "In my works I often refer to my memories, but this work is those very memories, or rather my visualization.\n\nAny memories are forgotten over time, they seem to dissolve, become less clear, less vivid and turn into colored spots, fragments of phrases and emotions that we felt at that time. The most stable memories are those that are fueled by strong emotions or those that are associated in our minds with certain odors, this is called the \"Proust phenomenon\", or olfactory memory. For example, my mom's baked goods remind me of home and tangerines remind me of New Year's Eve.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't give you smells through the monitor screen, but you can also trigger memories thanks to combinations of different colors and shapes, which our brain will draw, find associations and for everyone they will be different.\n\nSomeone will remember as a child spending time in the countryside and walking through the forest or meadow, someone will remember a rainy day and the lights of passing cars, a cozy warm evening with your family, your first meeting, the ocean, how you met the dawn after a sleepless night or something else unique to you, each picture will open differently for different people.\n\nEnjoy and try to remember and keep your memories.\n\nMade with p5js.",
