  description: "This is the final and closing part of the series telling the story of Portals.\n\nImperfect portals are just like our memories, over time memories lose their sharpness and some even lose their shape and in some cases take a completely new form, sometimes they may only have small pieces or spots of color left, but they still remain with us try not to lose them completely.\n\n15 colors\nAlso with some coincidence the shape of a circle can appear, thank you and good luck to you.\n\nMade with p5js.",
