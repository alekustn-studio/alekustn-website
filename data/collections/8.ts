  description: "This series of works is based on my reflections on the relationship between primitive art, namely rock art and modern art.\nIn works I often refer to the theme of nature and the world around me, trying to capture my feelings and emotions.\nThousands of years ago, the man sought to show what surrounds him.\nThis connection between the modern artist and the man who lived 65 thousand years ago and tried to depict the world around him for posterity is amazing.\n\nMade with p5js.",
