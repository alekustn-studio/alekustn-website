  description: `Portals - is a generative collection sending you into your Memories and dreams.

Our whole life consists of different memories, some of them good and some of them not, which is absolutely normal.
I think each of us sometimes dives into our memories and dreams to relive that moment again, maybe change something in it or even forget it forever ?
Each of the memories has its own color, atmosphere and mood, some memories are big, some are short.
You certainly noticed how some days and sometimes even minutes and seconds last unbearably long, as well as when the day flies by in the same breath and you do not even have time to notice how it passed.
Let Portals take you on a journey through your memories, and have more good memories.

Made with p5js.`,
